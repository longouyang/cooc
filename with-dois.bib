discusses "missing-feature theory" of word learning and two competing positions on the development of features in the domain of word learning:

1. dimension (e.g., vertical spatial extent) is learned first, then polarity
2. polarity is learned first, then spatial extent

carey says that experiments show {\#}2 to be more accurate, though she argues that missing feature theory is inadequate in general

evidence for {\#}2:
1. if they know the words big and little, children can do relative big/little judgments (e.g., is this a big shoe?) near ceiling
2. similar for tall/short
3. shown an array of objects varying in two dimensions and asked to indicate the shortest one, errors respect polarity but not dimension (though maybe comparatives are difficult? -est could be complex)

286: "there is evidence against stable incomplete lexical entries"

proposes "missing features and haphazard examples" theory, where adjectives only predicate over only certain kinds of objects},

prologue
overview
problem of induction
the latent semantic analysis model
- an informal explanation of the inductive value of dimensionality optimization
- a psychological description of lsa as a theory of learning, memory, and knowledge
- a neural net analog of lsa
- the singular value decomposition realization of lsa
- singular value decomposition
- a brief note on neurocognitive and psychological plausibility

evaluating the model
- lsa's acquisition of word knowledge from text
- the effect of dimensionality
- the learning rate of lsa versus humans and its reliance on induction
-- the rate and sources of schoolchildren's vocabulary acquisition
-- the rate and sources of lsa's vocabulary acquisition
-- details of estimating direct and indirect effects
-- details of lsa simulation of total vocabulary gain
-- simulating a schoolchild's learning
-- about the accuracy of the simulations
- conclusions from the vocabulary simulations

generalizing the domain of lsa
- other aspects of lexical knowledge
- real-world reference
- conditioning, perceptual learning, and chunking
- a new light on classical association theory
- analogy to episodic and semantic memories
- analogy to explicit and implicit memories
- expertise
- contextual disambiguation
- text comprehension: an lsa interpretation of construction-integration theory
-- predicting coherence and comprehensibility
-- simulating contextual word disambiguation and sentential meaning inference
-- mimicking the representation of single-digit arabic numerals
