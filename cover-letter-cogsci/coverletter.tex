\opening{Dear Editorial Board,}

Please accept our submission of a manuscript for a regular article titled ``Semantic coherence facilitates distributional learning'' to Cognitive Science. This manuscript has not been previously published and is not under consideration elsewhere. All research reported in this manuscript was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board. We plan to release raw data and code for our analyses on a publicly available Internet archive.

In our manuscript, we describe a series of empirical studies on distributional learning, a phenomenon in which learners might learn about a word from purely linguistic information---its patterns of co-occurrence with other words. Computational work suggests that co-occurrence information can in principle facilitate learning, but empirical work using artificial language learning shows that people are often unable to learn from co-occurrence regularities. However, these experiments generally present learners with entirely novel linguistic input. Our experiments show that distributional learning is facilitated by semantic coherence, the presence of known words that adhere to some semantic organization.

% As well as being interesting to readers who study artificial grammars and language acquisition, we believe this work is broadly engaging as an important case study on the character of purely statistical learning.

% A list of suggested reviewers includes: Richard Aslin, Jill Lany, Patricia Reeder, and Jennifer Saffran are all experts in the field of statistical learning.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you very much for your consideration.
