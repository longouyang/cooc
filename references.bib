- nouns tend to have more syllables than verbs (2), to have first-syllable stress (4), to end in voiced final consonants more often than verbs (12), to contain nasals more often than verbs (13)
- verbs tend to have second syllable stress (4)
- adjectives are more likely to end with a syllabified -ed (e.g., ``ragged'' is pronounced rag-id) (9). note that this pronunciation is not allowed for verbs
- remaining things: vowels in stressed syllables tend to be back vowels in nouns and front vowels in verbs (14). vowels in nouns tend to be back vowels and front vowels in verbs. vowels in nouns tend to be low and vowels in verbs tend to be high.}

prologue
overview
problem of induction
the latent semantic analysis model
- an informal explanation of the inductive value of dimensionality optimization
- a psychological description of lsa as a theory of learning, memory, and knowledge
- a neural net analog of lsa
- the singular value decomposition realization of lsa
- singular value decomposition
- a brief note on neurocognitive and psychological plausibility

evaluating the model
- lsa's acquisition of word knowledge from text
- the effect of dimensionality
- the learning rate of lsa versus humans and its reliance on induction
-- the rate and sources of schoolchildren's vocabulary acquisition
-- the rate and sources of lsa's vocabulary acquisition
-- details of estimating direct and indirect effects
-- details of lsa simulation of total vocabulary gain
-- simulating a schoolchild's learning
-- about the accuracy of the simulations
- conclusions from the vocabulary simulations

generalizing the domain of lsa
- other aspects of lexical knowledge
- real-world reference
- conditioning, perceptual learning, and chunking
- a new light on classical association theory
- analogy to episodic and semantic memories
- analogy to explicit and implicit memories
- expertise
- contextual disambiguation
- text comprehension: an lsa interpretation of construction-integration theory
-- predicting coherence and comprehensibility
-- simulating contextual word disambiguation and sentential meaning inference
-- mimicking the representation of single-digit arabic numerals

@incollection{carey1978,
author = {Carey, Susan},

year = {1978},
editor = {Halle, M and Bresnan, Joan and Miller, George A},
pages = {264--293},
publisher = {MIT Press},
annote = {p277:
discusses "missing-feature theory" of word learning and two competing positions on the development of features in the domain of word learning:

1. dimension (e.g., vertical spatial extent) is learned first, then polarity
2. polarity is learned first, then spatial extent

carey says that experiments show {\#}2 to be more accurate, though she argues that missing feature theory is inadequate in general

evidence for {\#}2:
1. if they know the words big and little, children can do relative big/little judgments (e.g., is this a big shoe?) near ceiling
2. similar for tall/short
3. shown an array of objects varying in two dimensions and asked to indicate the shortest one, errors respect polarity but not dimension (though maybe comparatives are difficult? -est could be complex)

286: "there is evidence against stable incomplete lexical entries"

proposes "missing features and haphazard examples" theory, where adjectives only predicate over only certain kinds of objects}
