\opening{Dear Editorial Board,}

Please accept our revisions of the manuscript for a regular article titled ``Semantic coherence facilitates distributional learning'' to Cognitive Science.

We again thank you for your careful study of the manuscript and we have included the two revisions you suggested.
We address the conceptual issue (p35) by acknowledging that our design may have biased participants to add to an existing language rather than construct a new one from whole cloth.
We address the methodological issue (footnote 4 on p15) by motivating our textual presentation of similarity stimuli .

% As well as being interesting to readers who study artificial grammars and language acquisition, we believe this work is broadly engaging as an important case study on the character of purely statistical learning.

% A list of suggested reviewers includes: Richard Aslin, Jill Lany, Patricia Reeder, and Jennifer Saffran are all experts in the field of statistical learning.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you very much for your consideration.
